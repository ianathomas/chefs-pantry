Chefs Pantry!
This backend serves to work with the "chefs-pantry-react" to construct and manage databases on a per user basis. 

To be specific, this back end talks to an api "spoonacular" to popluate a search bar with ingredients. Once an ingredient is searched, the app will check that ingredient for its ID, and If that ID does not already exist in the users "Pantry", they can then add this ingredient to their "Pantry"

This is a work in progress but I am quite proud of what it accomplishes at this stage. More to come!
